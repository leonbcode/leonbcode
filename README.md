> Hey stranger!
> It's me, Leon.
> Now let me tell you a few things about myself.
> I'm from Germany and right now I'm attending my last year at high school. 
> Probably I'll go to university and study computer science later this year.
  
> You are asking in which specific fields I have collected experience over the years? - great question!

> My journey began with various small Java applications. 
> Since then Java is my most preferred language. I'm using Java to this day in most of my projects.
> In the past I've also been working on some c++ projects, like image-to-ascii. 
> C#, JS, and Python are also languages I'm familiar with.

> Right now I'm mainly working on a firmware for my custom mechanical keyboard (atmega32u4)
  and besides that, I'm working as a volunteer developer for a Minecraft server.

> It was nice to meet you.
