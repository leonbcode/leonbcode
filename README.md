> Hey stranger!
> It's me, Leon.
> First let me tell you a few things about myself.
> I'm from Germany and in October I will study computer science at university.
  
> You are asking what experience I have collected over the years? - great question!

> My journey began with various small Java applications. 
> Since then Java is one of my favorite languages. I'm frequently using Java in my projects.
> C#, JS, and Python are also languages I'm familiar with.

> But right now I'm mainly interested in learning C++. (go and check out todopp :D)

> It was nice to meet you.
